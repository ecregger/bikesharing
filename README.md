##Overview:
This analysis of the citi bike system in NYC was performed in order to clearly present data to local administrators and investors in order to drum up support. There is a clear need in the community for alternative transportation for residents and tourist and a bike share could be an answer.

## Checkout time for users:
There is a clear answer that the wide majority of rides should be considere short, peaking at nearly 10 minutes.

## Checkout time for for users (by gender):
This is clearly more appealing to the male user as they are the majority of the user-base. Which begs the question, how can you broaden female appeal?

## Trips by weekday(hourly):
Thursday evengings from 5-6 are the hottest hour for some reason. Questions should be asked if this i sthe day when the most tourists arrive? What is significant?

## Trips by weekday (hourly AND by gender):
Men, being the primary user are most active between the 8-9am hours and the 5-6pm hours. I can understand this being a typical work schedule. The evening is much heavier so I assume that is related to tourism.

##  User trips by Gender (weekday AND user type):
There are far more subscribing males that use the program regularly, however, females are have a relatively high usage. Is this program subscribed to by a majority of locals or savvy tourists?

## Summary:
The two sections below "sum" it up. Where do these rental stations belong and what does maintenance look like? The answer is a bit unknown for maintenance until we can dig deeper but stations in business hubs and tourist locations (hotels) is a key to success. 

## Summary a: Starting Locations Map:
While there is usage all around, a heavy amount is centered around tourist destinations. However, these are also business and attraction hubs.

## Summary b: Bike Repair (potential):
this visualization will allow us to see the amount of bikes out there, and how many times they've been rented. While it's not the most direct correalation to repair need and cost, it's a good indicator to see the scale.
